This script creates a 400Ã—400 thumbnail of a specific page of a PDF file.

It uses similar thumbnailing logic to docstore [1], but it allows me to
pick a particular page rather than the first page.

This is helpful because sometimes I download PDF cross-stitch patterns
where the first page contains text which isn't a good thumbnail, but
later pages do show the whole pattern.
