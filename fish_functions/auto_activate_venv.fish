# This tells fish to auto-activate my virtualenvs when I change directories.
#
# I have a fairly simple naming convention for my virtualenvs: I put
# them in the root of the Git repo for each project, and I always
# name them `~/.venv`.  This means it's pretty easy to work out if
# a virtualenv exists for the current directory.
