# pathscripts

This is a collection of useful scripts and tools I keep in my [PATH].
I use this Git repository to sync them across multiple computers.

I use scripts over shell config for a couple of reasons:

-   Individual scripts are more portable.
    I can send you a script and you can start using it immediately, even if you use a different shell.

-   I can use different languages.
    I'm not restricted to whatever my shell uses.

-   It makes my shell start faster.
    I use [fish], and I've noticed that if I write large fish config files, there's a noticeable delay between starting a shell and getting my first prompt.
    Using scripts means I have smaller config files, and I get a first prompt faster.

## Usage

Individual scripts have header comments explaining what they do.
Download them and add them to your PATH.

You can also clone this entire repo, then add it to your PATH, if you want to use all the scripts.
