"""
This is a wrapper around yt-dlp that has a couple of special behaviours:

*   It does parallel downloads for YouTube playlists, which is must
    faster than vanilla yt-dlp.

*   It enforces a couple of rules around downloading subtitles, to ensure
    I always remember to download them in a consistent way.

The goal is that this is a drop-in replacement for vanilla yt-dlp: if it
downloads something, it downloads the exact same set of files.  You could
copy any command that uses this script onto a machine running the regular
tool and it would work as-is.  It might check extra rules or run faster,
but it should never download something different to the regular tool.
